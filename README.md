## Description

Github Lite is a web application designed for developers in order to showcase their work. Users can make an account, post their work, and view their own posts on their personal profile page. When sharing their work, the user can add a title, link, desciption, and technologies used.

For non-developers, the site can be used as a way to seek out developers that have the skills you need for a job. The simple interface allows a less intimidating user experience than Github. When viewing a project that interests you, the developerâ€™s name and an email to be contacted at will be displayed.

In addition, users can add comments to posts and add other users to their contact list.

## Installation

Just go to the website, create an account, and start posting!
