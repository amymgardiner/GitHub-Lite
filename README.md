# Deep Thoughts

## About Module 21 Lesson Activity - MERN

I built a social media application using the MERN stack. The app, named Deep Thoughts, allows users to sign up and create an account, post their thoughts, and interact with other users.

I used GraphQL in addition to my Express server, and implemented authentication using JWT.

By completing this module, I learned how to do the following:
-Explain the difference between GraphQL and RESTful APIs.
-Configure a proxy server for local development of a MERN application.
-Implement client-side routing using React Router.
-Build API endpoints with GraphQL in a MERN application.
-Successfully configure and deploy a MERN application to Heroku.
-Implement authentication with JWT.
